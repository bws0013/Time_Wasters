This is my first attempt at a monte carlo type simulation. The idea is that given a 2 card hand (ie texas holdem) and some number of community cards, what are your chances of winning agains one or more opponents.

Things to consider:
  - How many opponents?
  - How many revealed community cards?
  - Are the opponents playing any two cards or are they only playing hands above some threshold?
