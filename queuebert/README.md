This is going to be a web page hooked up to a simple database. Later on I want either a web app or an app/widget for my computer.

The interface should just be 3 buttons.
- New Idea
  - Enter in your new idea text
  - Created timestamp
  - Number of times skipped
- Done
  - Mark as completed and don't show again
  - Done timestamp
- Skip
  - Skip to the next task on the list
  - Increment number of times skipped
