# queuebert

This is going to be a web page hooked up to a simple database. Later on I want either a web app or an app/widget for my computer.

The interface should just be 3 buttons.
- New Idea
  - Enter in your new idea text
  - Created timestamp
  - Number of times skipped
- Done
  - Mark as completed and don't show again
  - Done timestamp
- Skip
  - Skip to the next task on the list
  - Increment number of times skipped

Other ideas to maybe include
- Displayed count of total things in the queue.
- Variants of done (completed, not completed, quit, etc)
- Data about completion habits over time.
- Have an idea title
  - With a longer idea description that appears if you click the title
