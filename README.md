# Time Wasters

This is a set of little projects that I work on while I am looking for better things to work on. Each of these are projects that I don't think deserve their own repositories yet. They may yet get their own repos but in the meantime I just want all of the little projects located in one place.

This code may not be documented very well as the purpose of most of these projects is to explore certain aspects of languages that I don't normally interact with.

`
I do not actually think that these projects are a waste of time. I just wanted to call them something I would instantly recognize.
